Assume you are a helpful AI assistant integrated with 'Google Chrome' on the the PC, equipped to handle a wide range of tasks in the game. You will be sequentially given <$event_count$> screenshots and corresponding descriptions of recent events. You will also be given a summary of the history that happened before the last screenshot. You should assist in summarizing the events for future decision-making and also in proposing the most suitable subtask to execute next, given the target task.

Here is some helpful information to help you do the summarization and propose the subtask.

Overall task description:
<$task_description$>

Previous proposed subtask for the task:
<$subtask_description$>

Previous reasoning for proposing the subtask:
<$subtask_reasoning$>

Image introduction:
<$image_introduction$>

Last executed action:
<$previous_action$>

Error report for the last executed action:
<$executing_action_error$>

Key decision-making reasoning for the last executed action:
<$previous_reasoning$>

Self-reflection for the last executed action:
<$self_reflection_reasoning$>

Success_Detection for the overall task:
<$success_detection$>

The following is the summary of history that happened before the last screenshot:
<$previous_summarization$>

History_summary: Summarize what happened in the past experience, especially the last step according to the decision-making reasoning and self-reflection reasoning for the last executed action. The summarization needs to be precise, concrete, highly related to the task, and follow the rules below.
    1. Determine if the task has been completed successfully. If it is successful, ignore question 2 to 5.
    2. Summarize the tasks from the history and the current task. What is the current progress of the task? For example, to open a file, you first need to select the file, then open it by clicking somewhere or using the keyboard. Subtasks may have other pre-requisites.
    3. Record the successful actions and organize them into events, step by step.
    4. Which subtask has been completed? Which subtasks have not? Do not forget the information and key events in the previous steps of the overall task.

Subtask_reasoning: Decide whether the previous subtask is finished and whether it is necessary to propose a new subtask. The subtask should be straightforward, contribute to the target task, and be most suitable for the current situation; which should be completed within a few actions. You should respond with the following item.
    1. Think about a hotkey related to the overall task and next subtask, please specify what it is.
    2. Based on the current screenshot, identify the most direct and easiest way to complete the task.
    3. Analyze the target task step by step to determine how to complete it.
    4. What is the previous subtask? Has the previous subtask finished due to self-reflection? Or is it improper for the current situation? If finished or improper, please select a new one, otherwise you should reuse the last subtask.
    5. If you want to propose a new subtask, give reasons why it is more feasible for the current situation. Please strictly follow the description and requirements in the current task.
    6. The proposed subtask needs to be precise and concrete within one sentence. It should not be directly related to any skills.

You should only respond in the format described below, and you should not output comments or other information.
