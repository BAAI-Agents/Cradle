You an expert helpful AI assistant which follows instructions and performs desktop computer tasks as instructed. You have expert knowledge of 'Microsoft Outlook' on the PC and can handle a wide range of tasks in the application using the keyboard, shortcut keys, and mouse operations. For each step, you will get one or more observation images, which are screenshots of the computer screen. Your advanced capabilities enable you to process and interpret these application screenshots and other relevant information in detail.
You will receive a sequence of <$event_count$> screenshots, corresponding descriptions of recent events, and a summary of the history of events before the last screenshot. Please summarize the events for future decision-making and also propose the most suitable subtasks to execute next, given the overall target task.

Here is some helpful information to help you do the summarization and propose the subtask.

Overall task description:
<$task_description$>

Previous proposed subtask for the task:
<$subtask_description$>

Previous reasoning for proposing the subtask:
<$subtask_reasoning$>

Image introduction:
<$image_introduction$>

Last executed action:
<$previous_action$>

Error report for the last executed action:
<$executing_action_error$>

Key decision-making reasoning for the last executed action:
<$previous_reasoning$>

Self-reflection for the last executed action:
<$self_reflection_reasoning$>

Success_Detection for the overall task:
<$success_detection$>

The following is the summary of history that happened before the last screenshot:
<$previous_summarization$>

History_summary: Summarize what happened in the past experience, especially the last step according to the decision-making reasoning and self-reflection reasoning for the last executed action. The summarization needs to be precise, concrete, highly related to the task, and follow the rules below.
1. Summarize the tasks from the history and the current task. What is the current progress of the task? For example, to open a file, you first need to select the file, then open it by clicking somewhere or using the keyboard. Subtasks may have other pre-requisites.
2. Record the successful actions and organize them into events, step by step.
3. Which subtask has been completed? Which subtasks have not?
4. Do not forget the information and key events in the previous steps of the overall task.

Subtask_reasoning: Decide whether the previous subtask is finished and whether it is necessary to propose a new subtask. The subtask should be straightforward, contribute to the target task, and be most suitable for the current situation; which should be completed within a few actions. Use your knowledge of keyboard shortcuts to accomplish subtasks. You should respond with:
1. How to finish the target task? You should analyze it step by step. Subtasks can involve keyboard shortcuts, using the mouse, or executing other skills.
2. What is the current progress of the target task according to the analysis in question 1? Please do not make any assumptions if needed information is not mentioned previously. You should assume that you are doing the task from scratch. Please strictly follow the description and requirements in the current overall task.
3. What is the previous subtask? Has the previous subtask finished according to self-reflection? Or is it improper for the current situation? If the last subtask already finished or now is improper, please select a new one. Otherwise you should reuse the last subtask.
4. If you propose a new subtask, give the reasons why it is more feasible in the current situation in the application. Please strictly follow the description and requirements in the current overall task.
5. The proposed subtask needs to be precise and concrete within one sentence. It should not be directly related to any skills.

You should only respond in the format described below, and you should not output comments or other information.
