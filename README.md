The Cradle framework empowers nascent foundation models to perform complex computer tasks
via the same unified interface humans use, i.e., screenshots as input and keyboard & mouse operations as output.

## ðŸ“¢ Updates
- 2024-06-27: A major update! Cradle is extened to four games: [RDR2](https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption2), [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/), [Cities: Skylines](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines/about), and [Dealer's Life 2](https://abyteentertainment.com/dealers-life-2/) and various software, including but not limited to Chrome, Outlook, Capcut, Meitu and Feishu. We also release our latest [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03186). Check it out!

# ðŸ’¾ Installation

## Prepare the Environment File
We currently provide access to OpenAI's and Claude's API. Please create a `.env` file in the root of the repository to store the keys (one of them is enough). 

Sample `.env` file containing private information:
```
OA_OPENAI_KEY = "abc123abc123abc123abc123abc123ab"
OA_CLAUDE_KEY = "abc123abc123abc123abc123abc123ab"
RF_CLAUDE_AK = "abc123abc123abc123abc123abc123ab"
RF_CLAUDE_SK = "123abc123abc123abc123abc123abc12"
IDE_NAME = "Code"
```
OA_OPENAI_KEY is the OpenAI API key. You can get it from the [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

OA_CLAUDE_KEY is the Anthropic Claude API key. You can get it from the [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).

RF_CLAUDE_AK and RF_CLAUDE_SK are AWS Restful API key and secret key for Claude API.

IDE_NAME refers to the IDE environment in which the repository's code runs, such as `PyCharm` or `Code` (VSCode). It is primarily used to enable automatic switching between the IDE and the game window.


## Setup

### Python Environment
Please setup your python environment and install the required dependencies as:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/BAAI-Agents/Cradle.git
cd Cradle

# Create a new conda environment
conda create --name uac-dev python=3.10
conda activate uac-dev
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Install Grounding Dino (only needed for RDR2)
```bash
# Install torch and torchvision
pip install --upgrade torch==2.1.1+cu118 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install torchvision==0.16.1+cu118 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

# Install the pre-compiled GroundingDino with the project dependencies
# 1. Download the weights to the cache directory
cd cache
curl -L -C - -O https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO/releases/download/v0.1.0-alpha2/groundingdino_swinb_cogcoor.pth
cd ..
# 2. Download the bert-base-uncased model from Hugging Face
mkdir hf
huggingface-cli download bert-base-uncased config.json tokenizer.json vocab.txt tokenizer_config.json model.safetensors --cache-dir hf
# 3. Install the groundingdino
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO.git
cd GroundingDINO
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
cd Cradle
```
If you encounter any issues during the installation of GroundingDINO, please refer to the official website [GroundingDINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO) or our provided [GroundingDino Installation Guide](docs/envs/groundingdino.md).

#### Download videosubfinder ï¼ˆonly needed for RDR2ï¼‰
Download the videosubfinder from https://sourceforge.net/projects/videosubfinder/ and extract the files into the res/tool/subfinder folder. We have already created the folder for you and included a test.srt, which is a required dummy file that will not affect results.

The file structure should be like this:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ res
  â”œâ”€â”€ tool
    â”œâ”€â”€ subfinder
      â”œâ”€â”€ VideoSubFinderWXW.exe
      â”œâ”€â”€ test.srt
      â”œâ”€â”€ ...
```

# ðŸš€ Get Started
Due to the vast differences between each game and software, we have provided the specific settings for each of them below.
1. [Red Dead Redemption 2](docs/envs/rdr2.md)
2. [Stardew Valley](docs/envs/stardew.md)
3. [Cities: Skylines](docs/envs/skylines.md)
4. [Dealer's Life 2](docs/envs/dealers.md)
5. [Software](docs/envs/software.md)
