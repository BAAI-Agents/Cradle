The Cradle project is a first attempt at General Computer Control (GCC). Cradle supports agents to ace any computer task by enabling strong reasoning abilities, self-improvment, and skill curation, in a standardized general environment with minimal requirements.

The framework and all materials are in constant evolution and this repository will include all released versions, along with publications and any other relevant assets.
