The Cradle framework empowers nascent foundation models to perform complex computer tasks
via the same unified interface humans use, i.e., screenshots as input and keyboard & mouse operations as output.

## 📢 Updates
- 2024-06-27: A major update! Cradle is extened to four games: [RDR2](https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption2), [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/), [Cities: Skylines](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines/about), and [Dealer's Life 2](https://abyteentertainment.com/dealers-life-2/) and various software, including but not limited to Chrome, Outlook, Capcut, Meitu and Feishu. We also release our latest [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03186). Check it out!

# 💾 Installation

## Prepare the Environment File
We currently provide access to OpenAI's and Claude's API. Please create a `.env` file in the root of the repository to store the keys (one of them is enough).

Sample `.env` file containing private information:
```
OA_OPENAI_KEY = "abc123abc123abc123abc123abc123ab"
RF_CLAUDE_AK = "abc123abc123abc123abc123abc123ab" # Access Key for Claude
RF_CLAUDE_SK = "123abc123abc123abc123abc123abc12" # Secret Access Key for Claude
AZ_OPENAI_KEY = "123abc123abc123abc123abc123abc12"
AZ_BASE_URL = "https://abc123.openai.azure.com/"
RF_CLAUDE_AK = "abc123abc123abc123abc123abc123ab"
RF_CLAUDE_SK = "123abc123abc123abc123abc123abc12"
IDE_NAME = "Code"
```
OA_OPENAI_KEY is the OpenAI API key. You can get it from the [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

AZ_OPENAI_KEY is the Azure OpenAI API key. You can get it from the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.CognitiveServices%2Faccounts).

OA_CLAUDE_KEY is the Anthropic Claude API key. You can get it from the [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).

RF_CLAUDE_AK and RF_CLAUDE_SK are AWS Restful API key and secret key for Claude API.

IDE_NAME refers to the IDE environment in which the repository's code runs, such as `PyCharm` or `Code` (VSCode). It is primarily used to enable automatic switching between the IDE and the target environment.


## Setup

### Python Environment
Please setup your python environment and install the required dependencies as:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/BAAI-Agents/Cradle.git
cd Cradle

# Create a new conda environment
conda create --name cradle-dev python=3.10
conda activate cradle-dev
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install the OCR Tools
```
1. Option 1
# Download best-matching version of specific model for your spaCy installation
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg

or

# pip install .tar.gz archive or .whl from path or URL
pip install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_lg-3.7.1/en_core_web_lg-3.7.1.tar.gz

2. Option 2
# Copy this url https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_lg-3.7.1/en_core_web_lg-3.7.1.tar.gz
# Paste it in the browser and download the file to res/spacy/data
cd res/spacy/data
pip install en_core_web_lg-3.7.1.tar.gz
```

# 🚀 Get Started
Due to the vast differences between each game and software, we have provided the specific settings for each of them below.
1. [Red Dead Redemption 2](docs/envs/rdr2.md)
2. [Stardew Valley](docs/envs/stardew.md)
3. [Cities: Skylines](docs/envs/skylines.md)
4. [Dealer's Life 2](docs/envs/dealers.md)
5. [Software](docs/envs/software.md)

# 🌲 File Structure
Since some users may want to apply our framework to new games, this section primarily showcases the core directories and organizational structure of Cradle. We will highlight in "⭐⭐⭐" the modules related to migrating to new games, and provide detailed explanations later.
